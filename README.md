# TRIVIA GAME WEBSITE CMPT 276

Features we want for Iteration 1 :

• creating a trivia game

• playing a trivia game already created by the developers

• logging in for users to create games

What went right?

• the views and styling are slightly consistent

• views redirect you to the correct view requested

• early start into some features (login and quiz creation)

What went wrong?

• our lack of knowledge in github and in general git workflow

• midterms delaying our start (I as a group leader procrastinated, and take responsibility)

• irregular meetings and lack of actual work done (mostly bug fixing and understanding what to do with git)

Things to improve :

• our understanding of github and git commands and what they do

• time management and planning
