# Basic things we want for the website :
#• Account creation and logging in with ways to personalize your account (displa picture the only idea discussed)
#• Game Creation
#• Game Playing (either the ones created by the developers themselves or the ones a user creates)
#• A Tab that allows you to manage your account
#• Categories for the Trivia games

Some other things talked about :
#• The Trivia games would be limited to 10 questions and each question would have a 1 minute timer
#• Have a homepage that allows you to see the games created by the developers and the specific categories a user could either add to or open to view and play those specific trivia games
